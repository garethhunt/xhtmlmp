XHTML Mobile Profile extension for Mozilla Firefox.

Firefox does support application/xhtml+xml content, but does not support application/vnd.wap.xhtml+xml by default.
This extension adds this support.

A Thank You:
The XHTML Mobile Profile extension is based upon the WML browser extension created by Matthew Wilson and
Raoul Nakhmanson-Kulish.  Many thanks to them for providing a framework that could be used for this.

See http://wmlbrowser.mozdev.org/index.html for more details of the WML browser.
